Changelog
=========

8.4.0 (2022-11-16)
------------------

* Added more details in the changelist table (in addition to what is configured in ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS``).
* Made some of the details in the changelist table more compact.

8.3.1 (2022-10-10)
------------------

* Add missing dependency on ``attrs``.

8.3.0 (2022-05-20)
------------------

* Added a bunch of links to Change/Inspect/Details in various pages and cleaned up code some more.
* Improved simplified/styling a bit.

8.2.2 (2022-05-19)
------------------

* Fix broken missing key check for databases different than the default one (usually 0) and render a full page instead of a text/plain 404.

8.2.1 (2022-05-18)
------------------

* Fixed issue with key stats being empty for databases different than the default one (usually 0). Turns out pipelines open up a new
  connection and need a select call.

8.2.0 (2022-05-17)
------------------

* Added a full details page.
* Added some headings in inspect pages.
* Fixed model name in breadcrumbs.
* Fixed empty media in inspect pages.
* Fixed inspect page giving 500 error for unavailable servers.

8.1.0 (2022-05-16)
------------------

* Added ``--version`` CLI option.
* Changed redisboard CLI admin header to show version and also fixed incorrect context that prevented AdminSite customizations overriding
  said header. Probably view site link also fixed.


8.0.1 (2022-05-15)
------------------

* Fixed incorrect settings loading of ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_CONVERTERS``.

8.0.0 (2022-05-15)
------------------

* Dropped support for Python 3.6.
* Overhauled internals to support customization of redis queries, deserialization and display using custom classes.
  For that purpose there are new settings: ``REDISBOARD_DECODER_CLASS``, ``REDISBOARD_DISPLAY_CLASS``, ``REDISBOARD_VALUE_QUERY_CLASS`` and
  ``REDISBOARD_LENGTH_QUERY_CLASS``.
* Fixed various issues with pagination by simplifying it and making the use of cursors transparent to the user.
  For this purpose the ``sampling_size`` and ``sampling_threshold`` models fields have been removed, and the ``REDISBOARD_ITEMS_PER_PAGE``
  was removed and replaced with ``REDISBOARD_SCAN_COUNT`` and ``REDISBOARD_STRING_PAGINATION``.
* Added new setting ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_CONVERTERS`` for customizing display of server details somewhat.
* Added new setting ``REDISBOARD_SLOWLOG_NUM`` option for limiting the slowlow displayed.
* The default value for the ``REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS`` setting was changed.
* Better connection management was implemented, both via render callbacks and ``__del__`` (as a fallback).
  There shouldn't be any connection leaks anymore. If the DEBUG setting is True then warnings
  will be issued should any connection be closed via ``__del__``.
* Added the ``--debug`` (to enable DEBUG and autoreload) and ``--decoder`` (to load a different data decoder) in the ``redisboard`` CLI.

7.0.1 (2022-05-12)
------------------

* Fixed ``--password`` killing the django session (it won't change the password and invalidate session if it's identical).
* Fixed some alignment regressions in the table cells.

7.0.0 (2022-05-12)
------------------

* Removed some of the more expensive and frankly pointless stats computations.
* Fixed internal error that occurred for empty databases.
* Cleaned up more code (hopefully all the Python 2 is all gone now).
* Changed the inspect page to include all the stats from the changelist.
* Changed the stats display to use tables instead of definition lists.
* Changed the ``--password`` CLI option to update the password regardless if the local sqlite was created or not.

  This allow SSL connection and whatever Redis will have in the future.

    in settings.
